# Social Network
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/SnUs5O5cdOQ
### Description:
A simple social network website with an authentication system, that requires users to log in. After registering, the website offers profile editing including updating your bio and profile photo. 

Then you can create and post content with optional images, all posts are sorted by timestamp and paginated, with ten items per page. Users can like and unlike posts and also follow and unfollow users.

This was one of the funniest projects that I have done. I learned a lot during its development.
 
#### Usage:
Configuring and hosting this website in your machine is pretty simple:
1. Download the project
1. While on the folder execute in the CMD:
 ```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
3. Now you're done! Website is hosted on [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) 

If you're having trouble, in the video demonstration I'm showing the process.

Questions, critics or suggestions I'd love to hear from you! ðŸ˜ƒ
